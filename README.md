## Simple Example

Here is a simple example of Python code that prints "Hello, World!":

```python
print("Hello, World")
```
## Linux
#### Step 1: Verify the Version of Python Pre-installed

Open a terminal and check if Python is already installed and its version with the command:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```
 
If Python is already installed, the command will display the version. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

#### Step 2: Update the Package Manager
Before installing Python, it's always good practice to update your system's package manager. Use the following command, depending on your system:

For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
For Red Hat-based systems (Fedora, CentOS, etc.):
```bash
sudo yum update
```
#### Step 3: Install Python

Now you can install Python using your system's package manager. Use the appropriate commands for your system:

For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.):
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```
For Red Hat-based systems (Fedora, CentOS, etc.):
```bash
sudo yum install python3
```
#### Step 4: Verify the Installation

After installation, check the Python version using:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If the installation was successful, it should display the Python version.

Remember that, on some systems, the command python might be used instead of python3. Make sure to adjust as necessary.
